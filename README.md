# MERN_Full_Stack
This project will be a practice on creating a basic full-stack MERN Application.

The concept will be a roster that users can use to add pirates to a list, they may also view the list of all the pirates that have been added, also the user can view a selected pirate where the pirate's attributes would be displayed, and delete (Walk the plank) pirates from the list as well.
